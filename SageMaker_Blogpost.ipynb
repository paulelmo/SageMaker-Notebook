    "## By using ready-made aws SageMaker Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "###### by Paul Klein\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with the basics of Big Data, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning and want to gain new knowledge and experience, aws SageMaker and its ready-made Notebooks are a good choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First of all what is aws:\n",
    ">*\"Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. This makes it faster, easier, and more cost effective to move your existing applications to the cloud and build nearly anything you can imagine.\"* [1](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### And second, what is SageMaker:\n",
    ">*\"Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment.\"* [2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do I mean by familiar? If you can tick all the following boxes, you should be familiar:\n",
    "* You know the difference between regression and classification and the fields of use.\n",
    "* You have heard of some Algorithms like k-Nearest-Neighbours, Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Principle Component Analysis.\n",
    "* You can handle Frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch or Chainer. \n",
    "* You understand the concept of aws.\n",
    "* You know to create and use Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ready?__ Ok, so let’s dive right in and climb the ML ladder: \n",
    "As you now know aws is a full-service Cloud-Provider. When people hear the word „cloud“ some might only think of storage and database solutions. But this was only the Beginning. Unfortunately they offer a huge variety of services. Like Image- and Objectrecognition, BI-and-CRM-Tools, Blockchain-Networks or VR-Applications. \n",
    "Most of their Services and Tools can be accessed by an API or using the aws Management Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/awsConsole.png \"aws Management Console\")\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pro Tip:__ If you are new to aws and don’t have an account you can get one for free. That’s not enough: With aws [free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) you can also access nearly every aws Service. There are some limitations in storage size and computing hours. Even if it’s free you have to provide your Credit Card-Details when registering. Best is to set a budget-limit so won’t be charged. If you are a student it’s even better: You get an aws [Education Account](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) with free Tutorials, 100$ Budget and won’t have to provide your Credit Card or Bank account. \n",
    "\n",
    "__1.\tBeginninng__\n",
    "Logging in to [aws Management Console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&client_id=signup) \n",
    "and start with typing Sagemaker in the search box and click on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro-Tip:** aws has several data-centers. If you have to comply with a special governance-policy, you can choose the right region for you. If you must comply with GDPR for example you can choose between five EU-locations. The location also matters for network-speed. Note: Only US-East-1 (N. Virginia) is currently supported for Student Accounts.\n",
    "\n",

    "Click on Notebook Instances on the left Side and then on create Notebook Instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/createInstance.png \"How to create  an Instance\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro-Tip:** By setting Lifecycle configurations you can set default scripts that run every time a notebook is started or created. By using this method you are working more efficient because you don’t need to specify often used libraries, tools or storage locations every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/Lifecycle.png \"Lifecycle configurations\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.\tOptions when creating a new notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1.\tNotebook Instance Type**\n",
    "Sagemaker provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different machine learning (ML) use cases. The differ in the way the work is done. By using a mix of CPU, GPU, memory, and networking capacity. It’s up to you to choose the right instance type. It’s even possible to change the instance type on the fly. If your project grows bigger and bigger you can scale the resources bigger and bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/InstanceExample.png \"Instance Types\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "> ml.t2.medium = machine learning standard second generation medium size\n",
    "\n",
    "> ml.r5.2xlarge = machine learning memory optimized fifth generation extra large\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2.\tElastic Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up your learning progress you could choose an GPU-powered Instance type. On the other hand, GPU-powered instances are more expensive than CPU- or RAM-powered instances. But these are often too high in latency for real-time actions. If you don’t want a compromise you should look at Elastic Inference. Elastic Inference lets you attach just the right amount of GPU-powered inference acceleration to a Sagemaker Model. Pick the best CPU instance type for your application, attach the right amount of GPU acceleration and get the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3.\tPermissions and Encryption** \n",
    "\n",
    "IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. IAM is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.\n",
    "When registered for your first account you are starting with an all-access Single-Sign-In Account (also called root user). AWS strongly recommends not to use the root user for everyday tasks, not even administrative ones.  Instead you should start with individual IAM-roles. You can also encrypt your notebook. For further Details have a look at the aws Documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/PermissionsEncryption.png \"Permissions and Encryption\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4.\tOptional Customization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/OptionalCustomization.png \"Optional Customization\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Associate Git repositories with your notebook instance to save your notebooks in a source control environment that persists even if you stop or delete your notebook instance. You can associate one default repository and up to three additional repositories with a notebook instance. The repositories can be hosted in AWS CodeCommit, GitHub or on any other Git server. It can helpful for persistence, collaboration or learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5.\tFinished!**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are done with setting the parameters, you can click on *create notebook instance*. It may take a while if your notebook is active. Usually some minutes. Take a break, have yourself a Cup of Coffee and get ready for the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3.\tStart your Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "When your Notebook is in Service you can start it by using Jupyter or JupyterLab. In this Demo, we go with regular Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:**\n",
    "Always Stop your Notebooks when leaving. Even if there is computing, they are reducing your budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/InService.png \"Notebook is in service\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards click on SageMaker Examples\n",
    " \n",
    "![](images/overview_Notebooks_unexpanded.png \"Ready-Made Notebooks\")\n",
    " \n",
    "As you can see in the Images above there is a huge variety of different Examples. They are grouped by topics. Every topic is expandable. Pick the one that fits your needs the best. As we are going with BigData and Machine Learning we are choosing: “Customer Churn Prediction with XGBoost -\n",
    "Using Gradient Boosted Trees to Predict Mobile Customer Departure”. Click on “use” to start the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/overview_Notebooks.png \"XGBoost Notebook\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Notebook about:**\n",
    "> *\"The notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. Losing customers is costly for any business. Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/CustomerChurn.png \"Customer Churn Notebook\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The ready-made Notebook takes you through every step of a typical ML-cycle. It's been taken a public dataset, so it's easy to follow the instructions. Now you can see and learn how to build, train und learn using a XGBoost-Algorithm. Have fun and enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:**\n",
    "To make the most out of the tutorial and get a complete understanding it would be good to read about [aws S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_s3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When stopping or finishing your Work, always remember to remove the hosted endpoint and avoid beeing charging.\n",
    "\n",
